# 🧠 Predict the Introverts from the Extroverts  
_Kaggle Playground Series - Season 5, Episode 7_

This repository contains my solution to the [Kaggle Playground Competition: "Predict the Introverts from the Extroverts"](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e7).  
It was my **first Kaggle competition**, and I’m proud to have placed in the **top 20% on the private leaderboard**!

## 🏆 Goal of the Competition

The task is to predict whether a person is an **Introvert** or **Extrovert** based on their **personality traits** and **social behavior**.  
The dataset was synthetically generated using a deep learning model trained on the original Extrovert vs. Introvert Behavior dataset.  
While the synthetic data closely mimics the original distribution, it’s not an exact match.

- **Target variable**: Binary classification – Introvert (`0`) or Extrovert (`1`)  
- **Evaluation metric**: Accuracy score

## 📅 Timeline
- **Start Date**: June 30, 2025  
- **Final Submission Deadline**: July 31, 2025

## 📂 Repository Structure

This repo contains three key notebooks:

| Notebook | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `01_EDA.ipynb` | Exploratory Data Analysis: Understanding the dataset, distributions, and potential feature insights |
| `02_ML_Experiments.ipynb` | Training various models, hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, and evaluation |
| `03_Final_Submission.ipynb` | Final model selection and submission code used in the competition |

## 📌 Notes

- No external dependencies are required beyond standard Kaggle or data science libraries (e.g. `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `seaborn`).
- The dataset is already provided via the Kaggle competition page.

## ✅ Results

Achieved a spot in the **top 20% of participants** on the private leaderboard – a solid outcome for a first competition!
